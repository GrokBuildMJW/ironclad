## [Unreleased]

## [0.0.12] - 2026-06-22

### Changed
- **Internal DEV→Prod→Public promote finalized** (#40, epic #132): the release pipeline now runs as
  a single fail-closed gated flow — boundary → **full** test suite (incl. the MPR built-in, which
  the previous step missed) → docs gate (CHANGELOG + doc-reality-audit) → export gates →
  **PRE-publish clean-room** (wheel → fresh venv → import-smoke incl. `ack.sdk` → an example plugin
  builds against the installed SDK) → review → publish → prod redeploy; dry by default. Full
  automation (scheduled sync) deferred. (Core-maintainer machinery; downstream users never touch it.)

### Added
- **Example plugin + SDK clean-room guarantee** (#138, epic #132): a standalone example plugin
  (`examples/example-plugin/`) shows the separate-repo authoring shape — a package with a `skills/`
  dir + an `ironclad.plugins` entry point, built against `ironclad-ai`. The clean-room now
  import-smokes `ack.sdk` and **builds the example against the freshly-installed wheel**, asserting
  it registers its entry point, runs, and matches the SDK schema — proving a separate repo can build
  against the published artifact. 3 tests (skip in installed trees; the workflow covers that path).
- **Export-leak guard for internal plugins** (#137, epic #132): the boundary check + export
  secret-sweep now forbid the internal plugin repo name, and a leak-guard test pins the guarantee
  (the guards flag a synthetic leak; the real `core/` + `clients/ink` tree is clean). `core/`
  couples to plugins only via the generic `ironclad.plugins` entry-point group — never a concrete
  private plugin. (The guards live in `scripts/ci/`, private; the test skips in installed/clean-room
  trees where they're absent.) 4 tests.
- **Packaged-plugin loading via entry points** (#136, epic #132): a pip-installed plugin
  (3rd-party or internal) is discovered at startup through the `ironclad.plugins` **entry-point
  group** — additively alongside built-ins + `GX10_PLUGINS_DIR`, with no path config and no core
  change. Dependency-inverted: the engine resolves each entry point to a plugins dir
  (package / callable / path) and scans it; it **never imports a concrete plugin**. Broken entry
  points are fail-soft. [ADR-0004](docs/adr/0004-extension-sdk.md), `plugin-api.md`. 10 tests.
- **Extension SDK (`ack.sdk`)** (#72, epic #132): a curated, versioned import surface to build a
  plugin in a **separate repo** against `pip install ironclad-ai` — re-exports the tool/playbook/
  prompt kinds, the registration/eval `gate`, `derive_tool_schema`, `Localizer`, and the
  `catalogue`. `ack.sdk.__all__` **is** the public API; everything else under `ack.*`/`engine.*`
  is internal. Provisional while `0.0.x`, semver from 1.0. [ADR-0004](docs/adr/0004-extension-sdk.md)
  + `plugin-api.md` (separate-repo workflow). 7 tests. *(The contract modules already shipped in
  the `ironclad-ai` wheel; this adds the curated surface, the stability policy, and the docs — no
  distribution change. The packaged-plugin `ironclad.plugins` entry-point seam is in development, #136.)*

## [0.0.11] - 2026-06-21

### Added
- **Curated multilingual starter prompt library + eval gate** (#111): four built-in `kind: prompt`
  items ship under `skills/prompts/` — `code-review`, `commit-message`, `bug-report`,
  `explain-code` (EN + DE, each loaded at startup and offered via `use_prompt`). New
  `ack.gate.gate_prompt` is the registration/eval gate for prompt items (required vars must appear
  in the template; every declared language must assemble cleanly; present locale overlays validated)
  and `ack.gate.gate()` auto-routes `kind: prompt` SKILL.md here. `discover_playbooks` now skips
  prompt items cleanly. **A new prompt = drop an MD file, no engine change.** 20 tests.
- **Prompt slash surface & guided elicitation** (`use_prompt`, #110): a discovered `kind: prompt`
  item is exposed as an engine tool — call with no capability to **list**, or with a capability +
  a `values` JSON of what's collected so far to drive **guided elicitation** (the tool returns the
  next missing required variable's question, one at a time) and, once complete, the **assembled**
  prompt in the target `lang` (preview). Wired through `_load_skills`/`_effective_tools`/dispatch;
  the state machine is `ack.promptgen.run_prompt` (deterministic, LLM-free). 9 tests.
- **Multilingual prompt assembly** (`ack.promptgen`, #109): `assemble(prompt, values, lang)`
  renders a `kind: prompt` template + collected values into a finished prompt in a target
  language via `ack.i18n` (per-item `locales/`, source/target + fallback); `missing_required()`
  drives the elicitation loop. Deterministic, LLM-free. 6 tests.
- **Prompt-library item format** (`ack.prompt`, `kind: prompt`, #108): parse/validate/discover a
  declarative prompt item (variables + languages + per-variable elicitation), reusing the shared
  `ack.playbook` frontmatter parser (one parser, no parallel infra). A prompt is a core built-in,
  distinct from `kind: playbook`. 7 tests.
- **Design: prompt library & generator** ([ADR-0003](docs/adr/0003-prompt-library.md) +
  [`prompt-packaging.md`](docs/prompt-packaging.md), epic #105) — a curated, multilingual prompt
  library on the core base: a prompt is a declarative `kind: prompt` core built-in (variables +
  languages + guided elicitation), reusing `ack.playbook`/`ack.catalogue`/`ack.gate`/`ack.i18n`;
  `/<prompt-name>` → elicit → multilingual assembly → preview. Design only — built under epic #105.

## [0.0.10] - 2026-06-21

### Changed
- **Export/deploy/docs aligned to core MPR** (#116): `export_core.py` drops the separate MPR
  bundling (MPR ships via the core/ copy + is covered by the core boundary check); the install
  launchers no longer set `GX10_MPR`; the installer no longer copies a separate `skills/mpr`; the
  MPR README documents the single runtime `mpr.enabled` gate. Finalizes the `GX10_MPR` deprecation.
- **MPR is now a core, always-on built-in** (#115): moved `skills/mpr` → `skills/mpr`;
  removed the `GX10_MPR` load gate (MPR is always loaded) — the live on/off is the runtime
  config **`mpr.enabled` (default ON)**. MPR consumes the core registry + `ack.i18n` + catalogue
  + gate. Back-compatible (behavior unchanged when enabled); its suite (381) is now part of the
  core `pytest` run, so the private CI gates it too. **Deprecation:** `GX10_MPR` is gone — use
  `mpr.enabled` (or `GX10_MPR_ENABLED`) instead.

### Added
- **Always-on core built-in loader** (#114): built-in skills/prompts load at startup from a
  fixed core dir (`skills/`), scanned **unconditionally** — independent of
  `GX10_PLUGINS_DIR`, which stays the **additive** surface for 3rd-party/user skills
  (`_load_skills`). Built-ins now work out of the box with no config. 4 tests.
- **Shared content i18n `ack.i18n`** (#107): the file-overlay locale loader is promoted to core as
  `Localizer(locales_dir)` — flag-independent (always importable, no `GX10_MPR`/plugin coupling),
  parameterized locales dir, English fallback. MPR migrated onto it (`skills/mpr/i18n.py` is now a
  thin shim; 382 tests green, behavior unchanged). Distinct from `engine/messages.py` (engine
  chrome). 6 tests. Part of the core-always-on rebuild (ADR-0002).
- **Design: skill/prompt/MPR as core always-on** ([ADR-0002](docs/adr/0002-core-always-on-skills.md),
  epic #112) — built-ins load from a fixed core dir independent of `GX10_PLUGINS_DIR`; the plugin
  surface stays for 3rd-party skills; MPR de-plugined into core (runtime `mpr.enabled`, default on,
  replacing the `GX10_MPR` boot flag). Design only — implemented under epic #112.

## [0.0.9] - 2026-06-21

### Added
- **Skill lifecycle verified end-to-end** (#88): a model-free integration test drives the full
  pipeline for both kinds — `ack.skillgen` generate → `ack.gate` registration gate →
  `ack.catalogue` install/register → engine load (`_load_plugins`/`_load_playbooks`) → invoke
  (a typed tool returns a real result; a playbook loads via `use_skill`). This is the epic #22
  C2 runnable scenario. 3 tests.

### Changed
- **`mpr` migrated as the reference built-in** (#90): its `CASE` now carries the catalogue
  manifest fields (`type`/`version`/`provenance`), so `ack.catalogue` indexes it as a built-in
  skill — proving the generalized format is a superset of the real flagship. Additive +
  back-compatible (byte-identical when gated off; mpr suite 382 green).

### Added
- **Skill registration gate** (`ack.gate`, #34): no unchecked skill enters the toolset. A tool
  must pass a doctor preflight (loadable, `CASE`+`capability`, synchronous `run`, derivable tool
  schema) and ship an auto-generated test; a playbook must have valid `SKILL.md` frontmatter +
  readable references + a passing `scripts/check`. Behavioral `eval/` stays opt-in. 7 tests. Also
  made the scaffolded playbook `scripts/check` self-contained (no import path assumptions).
- **Skill library catalogue** (`ack.catalogue`, #35): a self-hosted, versioned index over both
  skill kinds, reading each skill's own metadata as its manifest (`capability`/`kind`/`version`/
  `type`/`domain`/`provenance`/`source`). Discover, install (copy into the active `skills/`),
  and update-when-newer (semver), with provenance and built-in vs user libraries — no external
  marketplace. Zero new deps; 6 tests.
- **Skill generator** (`ack.skillgen`, #33): `spec → schema-valid scaffold` for both skill
  kinds — a typed `CASE`+`run` `.py` (signature → tool schema) with an auto-test stub, or a
  `SKILL.md` playbook package + `references/` + `scripts/check`. Contract-correct by
  construction; the body is a marked stub for an author/LLM to fill. CLI `python -m ack.skillgen`.
  Zero new deps; 7 tests.
- **Playbook skill kind** (`SKILL.md` packages, ADR-0001 / #89): a second skill kind alongside
  the typed `CASE`+`run` tool. `ack.playbook` parses + validates `SKILL.md` frontmatter and
  `Registry.discover_playbooks` discovers packages; the engine exposes them via the new
  **`use_skill`** tool with **progressive disclosure** (list metadata → load body → load a
  reference on demand). Zero new dependencies; 15 deterministic tests (`test_playbook.py`).
- **Skill-engine design**: [ADR-0001](docs/adr/0001-skill-engine-and-library.md) +
  [`skill-packaging.md`](docs/skill-packaging.md) — the design for the skill-generation engine
  & self-hosted library (two skill kinds: typed `CASE`+`run` tools and `SKILL.md` playbooks;
  doctor+tests registration gate with opt-in behavioral eval; manifest catalogue with semver +
  provenance; `skills/mpr` as the reference built-in). Design only — built under epic #22.

## [0.0.8] - 2026-06-21

### Added
- **Public-release clean-room gate** (`.github/workflows/clean-room.yml`, #58). Before any
  publish, the package is proven installable + runnable **from the published sources in
  isolation**: PRE-publish builds the wheel, installs it into a fresh venv (not `-e`),
  import-smokes from a neutral dir and resolves the `[engine]`/`[memory]` extras, and does a
  fresh `clients/ink` build + test; POST-publish installs the real package from PyPI and
  import-smokes. Catches forgotten dependencies/files before a user hits them.

### Fixed
- **Published doc link** (`engine/README.md` → the bundled `clients/ink/` client) now
  resolves in the released tree; the export now normalizes the `../` depth of links to the
  bundled siblings (`clients/ink`, `skills/mpr`), and a deterministic doc-reality audit gate
  guards against dead links/anchors, version drift, and stale claims going forward (#41).

### Changed
- **Docs: release-status & test counts reconciled to reality** (#59). The status/honesty
  sections (`README.md`, `docs/status.md`, `docs/roadmap.md`, `SETUP.md`) now state the
  actual release model — pre-release `0.0.x` alpha, tagged releases on PyPI (`ironclad-ai`)
  **and** GitHub Releases (`v0.0.7`), no stable 1.0 — instead of the stale "no tagged
  release". Test counts regenerated from `pytest --collect-only`: **468** Python
  (459 offline + 9 live) and **337** TypeScript client tests; `docs/test-report.md` area
  table updated to match.
- **English-only hygiene**: translated the remaining German code comments in the bundled
  test suite (`ack/tests/test_autoplan.py`, `test_client_pool.py`, `test_workers.py`) to
  English (#78). Deliberate `language=de` user-facing output and the German query-classifier
  keywords are intentionally kept.

## [0.0.7] - 2026-06-21

### Changed
- **Installer is type-aware + config-driven.** The `ironclad`/`ironclad-doctor` launchers now support both a
  local engine (`type: desktop`, default) and a thin client against a remote orchestrator (`type: spark`),
  and read optional tuning (`engineConfig`, `warmUrl`, `claudeBin`, `fanoutConcurrency`, `workersMaxTokens`,
  `workersMaxBatchTokens`) from the project config — absent → engine defaults, so a deployment can tune
  without editing scripts. Adds `install/ironclad-commands.ps1` (profile shim). All still secret-free.

## [0.0.6] - 2026-06-21

### Added
- **One-shot desktop installer** (`install/`, cross-platform, secret-free). Run `install/ironclad-install.sh`
  (Linux/macOS) or `install\ironclad-install.ps1` (Windows) once from a clone to build a venv, install the
  engine, build the optional TypeScript client, write a per-project config and wire an `ironclad` command —
  plus `ironclad` (launcher: engine-ensure + client, version-aware) and `ironclad-doctor` (status). All
  endpoints default to localhost and are overridable via flags / `GX10_*` env; nothing about a deployment is
  baked in. See [`install/README.md`](install/README.md), the *One-shot install* block in
  [`SETUP.md`](SETUP.md), and **Track D** in [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) (AI-agent install runbook).

### Changed
- The boundary check (`scripts/ci/check_core_boundary.py`) now also literal-scans `.ps1`/`.sh`, so the
  installers are held to the same secret-free contract as the rest of `core/`.

## [0.0.5] - 2026-06-21

### Changed
- **MPR is multilingual.** The deterministic report rendering (decision-matrix / comparison-matrix /
  risk-register / evidence-report templates), the synthesis prompts and the degrade/panel messages are
  now localized: **English is the source**, German ships as a locale overlay (`skills/mpr/locales/`),
  and the render language follows the configured output language. Adding a language is a data file, no
  code change.
- **Orchestrator system prompt hardened.** It now self-invokes plugin tools when a request matches a
  loaded tool (instead of telling the operator to type commands), never guesses initiative names from
  memory (the active initiative comes from state), and never invents command syntax.

### Fixed
- Python 3.10 compatibility for the bundled MPR plugin: its eval gate read TOML via the stdlib
  `tomllib` (3.11+ only). It now falls back to the `tomli` backport (declared as an `[engine]`
  dependency on `python_version < "3.11"`), so MPR loads and its tests pass on 3.10.
- **MPR decision matrix self-consistency:** the recommendation rationale no longer restates invented
  weighted sums — only the MPR-computed score is shown; the fallback line no longer doubles the trigger
  conjunction or the terminal period.
- **MPR conflict detection** no longer emits noise zones from query meta-vocabulary (question words,
  structural terms, criteria names) nor a fabricated top-recommendation conflict; inferred subjects are
  anchored to the question and de-duplicated.
- **MPR run indexing** in a reasoning-only initiative no longer attempts (and silently fails) a TaskStore
  write — consistent with the initiative type contract; the run's record is its manifest + the vault index.
- **MPR TaskStore binding** in the engine glue is fixed (it bound a function object, never an instance), so
  runs in a software initiative are indexed correctly.
- **CLI slash-command menu:** Tab and Enter accept the highlighted suggestion (a single match too), and an
  arrow key accepts a lone suggestion; the renderer's focus manager no longer swallows Tab.
- **CLI:** the MPR report's machine sentinels (`<<<MPR_REPORT>>>` / `<<<END>>>`) are stripped from the
  rendered chat.

## [0.0.4] - 2026-06-20

### Added
- **Initiative-centric state layout.** Engine machinery moves out of the project root into a hidden
  `state_root` (`.ironclad/`: `session.json`, the local warm-cache, the `active` marker) and every
  produced artifact lives under the **active initiative** `vault/<slug>/` — visible `decisions/`,
  `proposals/`, `reviews/`, `runs/`, `tasks/`; hidden `.work/` machine plumbing (active handover,
  handover/feedback inbox, archive). Initiative are created explicitly
  (`/initiative new|list|use|active|reconcile`, `--type mpr|software`); the `TaskStore`,
  `stage_handover`/`advance_pipeline`, reviews and the MPR `runs_dir` all route to the active
  initiative, **fail-closed** when none is active (no writes into the project root), while background
  scanners soft-skip. The local code-agent scratch moves to a hidden `.ironclad/agent/` drop zone.
  Overridable via `paths.state_root` / `paths.vault_root`. See [`docs/state-and-initiative.md`](docs/state-and-initiative.md).
- **Self-maintaining vault** (`reconcile_vault`, `/initiative reconcile`): deterministic, **LLM-free**
  upkeep — a regenerated `INDEX.md` (grouped, Obsidian `[[links]]`, manual prose preserved outside the
  AUTO block) plus an idempotent "Verwandt (auto)" relation block injected into curated docs
  (shared frontmatter tags / title reference). Auto-fires index-only after a write (initiative create,
  `stage_handover`, `advance_pipeline`, an MPR run); the full link pass runs on the explicit command.
- **MPR multi-perspective reasoner** (`skills/mpr/`) now ships in the OSS as the flagship plugin
  example: an expert role-panel router → governed fan-out → deterministic synthesis (decision-matrix /
  comparison / risk / evidence templates) with a sovereignty/budget-gated audit trail. Loaded via the
  open plugin surface (`GX10_PLUGINS_DIR`), runtime-gated by `mpr.enabled` (default off), used through a
  `--type mpr` initiative. See [`skills/mpr/README.md`](skills/mpr/README.md).
- **Operator security guide** ([`docs/security.md`](docs/security.md)): the trust profiles
  (`open`/`token`/`sealed`), their config keys + env overrides, the gated routes, the session
  lifecycle, and the client header contract — in one place.

### Changed
- `session.json` now lives under `.ironclad/` (was `.gx10_session.json` in the project root).
- Default workspace no longer scatters `tasks/`/`summaries/`/`reviews/` into the project root.
- **Warm tier wired by default** — the shipped `docker-compose` now sets `GX10_WARM_URL` to the
  `mem-valkey` loopback, so the warm tier (rolling summary + retrieval cache) activates automatically
  under `--profile memory` (fail-soft otherwise); previously the container shipped but was never wired.
- **`security.profile` is now a boot-only (frozen) config key** — `/config set security.profile …` is
  refused (it wires the trust policy + bind host once at boot); set it in the deploy and restart.
- **Plugin tool names must be unique** — a name clash now keeps the first-loaded tool and warns,
  instead of silently shadowing it.
- **Docs reconciled against the code** (a 10-dimension docs↔code audit): `status.md`, `setup-types.md`,
  `config-runtime.md`, `plugin-api.md`, `code-agents.md`, README/SETUP/AGENTS — corrected over-claims
  (the boundary check does not sandbox plugins), completed the env/config surface, added the
  `/initiative new` onboarding prerequisite, and refreshed the test counts.

## [0.0.3] - 2026-06-19

### Added
- **Scalable-context memory** (multi-tier, default-on when a memory/warm service is configured):
  a **warm tier** (BSD-licensed in-memory store) holding the rolling conversation summary,
  recent-turn state, and a short-TTL retrieval cache that survives a server restart and is shared
  across the reasoning workers; **rolling/hierarchical summarization** on eviction (raw archived
  to long-term, prefix-stable); **per-turn retrieval (RAG)** assembly; **token-accurate budgeting**
  that scales the working set to the model window; **chunked, lossless** long-artifact store with
  recency tie-breaking; a **`deep_query_memory`** tool for the relational (graph) path; and
  **parallel workers as memory citizens** (shared summary + per-item retrieval on read, single-writer
  reducer on write). All additive and fail-soft — with the warm/cold tiers down, a turn still
  completes. Server-side only (same HTTP contract, no new client coupling).
- **Recommended TypeScript terminal client** (`clients/ink/`) on a purpose-built renderer:
  slash-command autocomplete, local shell via `!cmd`, in-CLI `/update` (rebuild + reinstall),
  `/reset` + opt-in `/resume`, per-project session storage (`<codedir>/.ironclad-cli/`), and
  preserved + syntax-highlighted code display (`/cat` fences with the language from the extension).
- **Secure, session-gated channel** (single-tenant): selectable trust profiles
  `open` / `token` / `sealed`, a client-managed tunnel option, and an explicit session
  that seals on disconnect. The token is a deployment secret, not a user login.
- **Governed reasoning parallelism**: a fan-out governor (concurrency × max_tokens budget
  envelope) plus an in-engine `parallel_reason` tool. Conservative core defaults.
- **Function-calling robustness**: validate→reask on every tool argument, and recovery of
  tool calls from text for endpoints without native tool-calls (explicit markers only).
- **Runtime contract self-check**: `GET /doctor` + a boot summary.
- **Open plugin surface**: discover `skills/*.py` plugins from `GX10_PLUGINS_DIR` and
  expose each as an agent tool — no core change. See `docs/plugin-api.md`.
- **Pluggable code-agent CLI** via `GX10_AGENT_CMD` (not locked to Claude Code).
- **Dev environment**: `Dockerfile.dev` + `docker-compose.dev.yml` build + run the full
  test suite in a container (the build+test gate). See `docs/dev-environment.md`.
- Beginner on-ramp: `docs/self-maintenance.md` ("describe an idea, let the agents build
  it"), top-of-README quickstart.

### Fixed
- Headless code-agent could not write files without a permission mode (now
  `--permission-mode`, default `acceptEdits`).
- `/tasks` was readable without the deployment secret under the auth profiles (now gated).
- Tool-call text recovery could hijack a bare JSON answer into a destructive call
  (bare-object branch removed; explicit markers only).
- Auth-gate / router path normalization; request-body cap; tunnel child reaped on failure;
  config-tree skips hidden subdirs; UTF-8-safe output (no cp1252 crash).

### Notes
- Single-tenant by design; multi-user identity/authorization is not built (see
  `docs/roadmap.md`). Treat `main` as a development snapshot.
